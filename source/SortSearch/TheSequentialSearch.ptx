  <title>The Sequential Search</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>When data items are stored in a collection such as a list, we say that
            they have a linear or sequential relationship. Each data item is stored
            in a position relative to the others. In Java arrays and ArrayLists, these relative
            positions are the index values of the individual items. Since these
            index values are ordered, it is possible for us to visit them in
            sequence. This process gives rise to our first search technique, the
            <term>sequential search</term>.</p>
  <p><xref ref="i11_id1fig-seqsearch"/>  shows that if we start
            at the first item in the list and move from item to item,
            we follow the underlying sequential order until we either find what
            we are looking for or run out of items, which would mean the item
            we were searching for was not present.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>The Java implementation for this algorithm is shown in the following program.  <xref ref="lst-seqsearch"/>
            The function needs two items&#x2013;the array and the item we
            are looking for&#x2013;and returns a boolean value as to whether it is present.</p>

    <title>Analysis of Sequential Search</title>
    <p>To analyze searching algorithms, we need to decide on a basic unit of
                computation. Recall that this is typically the common step that must be
                repeated in order to solve the problem. For searching, it makes sense to
                count the number of comparisons performed. Each comparison may or may
                not discover the item we are looking for. In addition, we make another
                assumption here. The list of items is not ordered in any way. The items
                have been placed randomly into the list. In other words, the probability
                that the item we are looking for is in any particular position is
                exactly the same for each position of the list.</p>
    <p>If the item is not in the list, the only way to know that is to compare it
                against every item present. If there are <m>n</m> items, then the
                sequential search requires <m>n</m> comparisons to discover that the
                item is not there. In the case where the item is in the list, the
                analysis is not so straightforward. There are actually three different
                scenarios that can occur. In the best case we will find the item in the
                first place we look, at the beginning of the list. We will need only one
                comparison. In the worst case, we will not discover the item until the
                very last comparison, the <em>n</em>-th comparison.</p>
    <p>What about the average case? On average, we will find the item about
                half way into the list; that is, we will compare against
                <m>\frac{n}{2}</m> items. Recall, however, that as <m>n</m> gets large,
                the coefficients, no matter what they are, become insignificant in our
                approximation, so the complexity of the sequential search is
                <m>O(n)</m>. <xref ref="sort-search_tbl-seqsearchtable"/> summarizes these results.</p>

    <p>We assumed earlier that the items in our collection had been randomly
                placed so that there is no relative order between the items. What would
                happen to the sequential search if the items were ordered in some way?
                Would we be able to gain any efficiency in our search technique?</p>
    <p>Assume that the list of items was constructed so that the items are in
                ascending order, from low to high. If the item we are looking for is
                present in the list, the chance of it being in any one of the <m>n</m>
                positions is still the same as before. We will still have the same
                number of comparisons to find the item. However, if the item is not
                present there is a slight advantage. <xref ref="fig-seqsearch2"/> shows this
                process as the algorithm looks for the item 50. Notice that items are
                still compared in sequence until 54. At this point, however, we know
                something extra. Not only is 54 not the item we are looking for, but no
                other elements beyond 54 can work either since the list is sorted. In
                this case, the algorithm does not have to continue looking through all
                of the items to report that the item was not found. It can stop
                immediately. <xref ref="lst-seqsearch2"/> The following program shows this variation of the
                sequential search function.</p>

    <p><xref ref="sort-search_tbl-seqsearchtable2"/> summarizes these results. Note that in the best
                case we might discover that the item is not in the list by looking at
                only one item. On average, we will know after looking through only
                <m>\frac {n}{2}</m> items. However, this technique is still
                <m>O(n)</m>. In summary, a sequential search is improved by ordering
                the list only in the case where we do not find the item.</p>
